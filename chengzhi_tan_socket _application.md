## PROJECT

1. Did you select a project from our list? If yes, which project did you select? Why did you choose this project? If you are proposing a project, give a description of your proposal, including the expected results.

    Yes, `Develop Socket API for Lunatik`.

    I chose this project because I hope I can implement a way to reduce the barrier to kernel development. I have some Linux kernel and operating system learning experience and I found that without the necessary knowledge detail of kernel mechanism, it is hard to modify the behavior of an operating system.

    Due to the complex of Linux Kernel, developing Linux modules or changing kernel behavior become something difficult for people who are unfamiliar with the kernel. Obscure macros and pointers are found everywhere in kernel source files. These difficulties impede many developers involved kernel programming.

    Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language, which brings another option for kernel developers. My goal is that by hiding annoying macros and complex API calling, developing a kernel socket program can become super easy and only needs few Lua codes. This goal coincides with the expected results of the project.

2. Please provide a schedule with dates and important milestones/deliverables, in two week increments.

    1. Week 1 – 2

        Implement Lua bindings for wrappers of kernel socket APIs.

        ```c
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_sendmsg);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_recvmsg);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(sock_create_kern);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(sock_release);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_bind);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_listen);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_accept);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_connect);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_getsockname);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_getpeername);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_getsockopt);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_setsockopt);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_sendpage);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_sock_ioctl);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_sock_shutdown);
        ```

        To do that, a wraper of `struct socket` and `sockaddr` is also requred (Some nest structures like `socket_wq`, `proto_ops` e.t.c are not included).

        That all are low-level API bindings.

    2. Week 3 - 4

        Implement a user-friend high-level encapsulation of socket. The possible APIs are

        ```lua
        net.createTCPClient()
        net.createTCPServer()
        net.createUDPSocket()
        net.multicastJoin(if_ip, multicast_ip)
        net.multicastLeave()

        net.server:close()
        net.server.listen([port],[ip],function(net.socket))
        net.server.getaddr()

        net.tcpsocket:close()
        net.tcpsocket:connect(port, ip|domain)
        net.tcpsocket:getpeer()
        net.tcpsocket:getaddr()
        net.tcpsocket:send(string[, function(sent)])
        net.tcpsocket:read()

        net.udpsocket:close()
        net.udpsocket:listen()
        net.udpsocket:read()
        net.udpsocket:send(string[, function(sent)])
        net.udpsocket:getaddr()
        ```

        Those APIs refer [NodeMCU's net module](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/5073c199c01d4d7bbbcd0ae1f761ecc4687f7217/docs/en/modules/net.md)

    3. Week 5 - 6

        Implement more user-friend high-level encapsulations, especially `poll`. The possible APIs are

        ```lua
        net.server:poll(...)

        net.tcpsocket:ttl([ttl])
        net.tcpsocket:timeout([timeout])

        net.udpsocket:ttl([ttl])
        net.udpsocket:timeout([timeout])

        net.dns.getdnsserver(dns_index)
        net.dns.resolve(host, function(sk, ip))
        net.dns.setdnsserver(dns_ip_addr, dns_index)

        net.ping(addr[, ttl])
        ```

    4. Week 7 - 8

        Using kernel thread to implement event callback. For example,

        ```lua
        srv = net.createTCPServer()
        srv:on("receive", function(sck, c) print(c) end)
        -- Wait for connection before sending.
        srv:on("connection", function(sck, c)
        sck:send("GET /get HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org\r\nConnection: close\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n")
        end)
        srv:connect(80,"httpbin.org")
        ```

        Inspired by [NodeMCU's net module](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/5073c199c01d4d7bbbcd0ae1f761ecc4687f7217/docs/en/modules/net.md#netsocketon)

        And some other advanced socket options:

        ```lua
        net.tcpsocket:buffer([send_buffer, read_buffer])
        net.tcpsocket:dontLinger([on])
        net.tcpsocket:noDelay([on])
        ...
        ```
        
    5. Week 9 - 10

    Finishing all uncompleted features, doing tests, fixing bugs and doing benchmarks.

    6. week 11- 12

    Fixing bugs and completing documents.

3. What will be showable one month into the project?

    All APIs related to directly wrap Linux socket function and a demo to show how to use them.

4. What will be showable two months into the project?

    All APIs related to advanced socket encapsulations and a demo to show how to use them.
